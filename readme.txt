== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wpcoupon-plugin-standard-version` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->Coupon Plugin screen to configure the plugin. Add your coupon codes and fill in your response emails. 
4. Make sure you configure Settings->Coupon Plugin>reCaptcha Options to enable bots from retrieving codes.
5. Add your short code for example, [coupon title=“YourTitle“] on your page.
6. Test it out.  Most issues occur with setting up your email.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I configure the email settings? =

The email settings for the plugin are the same for setting up your normal email account.  So you will need the SMTP server info, username and passwords.

= Do you support SSL emails? =

Yes.  You can configure SSL email support on the email setup screen.

= Are my settings stored on your servers? =

No.  Your settings are stored in your Wordpress database.  We do not have access to your site or plugin settings.

= Are you available to customize the plugin? =

Yes.  We offer contract development.  Visit www.meamobile.com or write info@meamobile.com to connect with us today.

= How many codes can the system store? =

The limit of codes is determined by your site host; specifically it is determined by your site hosts database limitations.  We’ve successfully added 5,000 codes and haven’t had any issues.  It’s likely the system will work with many more.

= Anything essential to know? =

Make sure you backup your site frequently. WordPress is a complex piece of software which may run into unforeseen situations. There is no warranty and no guarantees for this software.
